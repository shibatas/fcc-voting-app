# freeCodeCamp Voting App project
by Shohei Shibata

This is my first-ever attempt at a full-stack web app. All feedbacks are highly welcomed!

## Objectives
Per [FCC website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app):
> Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

> Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
>
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
> * User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
> * User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
> * User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
