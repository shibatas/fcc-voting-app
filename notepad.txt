***TO DO
    - Share poll via twitter or facebook (this means each poll needs a unique URL)
    - Add choices to an existing poll
    - When creating poll, changing # of choices shouldn't delete all input (append instead of re-render)
    - Limit some features to logged in users (creating/deleting poll)
